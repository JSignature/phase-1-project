## User Story

    As a user I would like to be able to select a color so that I can get the values I can use in my code in various formats.

    As a user I would like to get complementary colors to the one I have chosen so I can have a variety of colors in my code.

## Website Interaction

    Use the picker that displays upon page render in order to choose a color you would like the values for.

            The values for the color you have selected will appear below a color swatch

    Use the accordion display to select a group of complementary colors

            The values will display and a copy button will be available to bring your text to the clipboard for use elsewhere

## Event Listeners

    1.  DOM content loaded
    2.  On change for color picker
    3.  Click event on copy buttons next to complementary colors
